# What is Python?

# Python is simple & easy

# Free & Open Source

# High Level Language

# Developed by Guido van Rossum

# Portable


# Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language known for its simplicity, readability, and versatility. It was created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991. Python is designed to emphasize code readability, making it an excellent language for both beginners and experienced developers.

# Key Features of Python:

# Readability and Simplicity: Python’s syntax is clean and easy to understand, which makes coding more intuitive and accessible.

# Interpreted Language: Python code is executed line by line, which makes debugging easier but can result in slower performance compared to compiled languages.

# Dynamically Typed: You don’t need to declare the type of a variable when defining it. Python determines the type at runtime, giving it flexibility.

# High-level Language: Python abstracts away most of the complex details of the machine, allowing you to focus on programming logic rather than worrying about memory management.

# Cross-platform: Python is cross-platform, meaning you can run Python code on various operating systems like Windows, Linux, macOS, etc.

# Extensive Standard Library: Python comes with a comprehensive standard library, which provides tools suited for many tasks such as working with files, handling data, internet protocols, and more.

# Large Ecosystem of Third-party Libraries: Python’s community has developed an extensive range of third-party libraries (e.g., NumPy for scientific computing, Django for web development, and TensorFlow for machine learning) which extends Python’s capabilities significantly.

# Object-oriented and Functional Programming: Python supports multiple programming paradigms, including object-oriented, procedural, and functional programming.
