# In programming, a variable is a container (storage area) to hold data. For example,

number = 10

# Here, number is a variable storing the value 10.

name = "almizan"
print(name)  

# In the above example, we assigned the value almizan to the name variable. Then, we printed out the value assigned to name

# *Changing the Value of a Variable in Python

name_1 = "almizan"
print(name_1)

name_1 = "shaikh"
print(name_1)

# Here, the value of site_name is changed from 'almizan' to 'shaikh'

# *Assigning multiple values to multiple variables

a,b,c, = 2,3,"hello"

print(a)
print(b)
print(c)

# If we want to assign the same value to multiple variables at once, we can do this as:

class1 = class2 = "good class"
print(class1)
print(class2)
